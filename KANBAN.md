# Olympus Project KANBAN

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Considerations

### Infrastructure Optimization

- [ ] **LadonStack Dedicated Hardware**
  - Raspberry Pi 4 with 4x 3.5" SSD HAT
  - Potential RAID configuration for redundancy
  - Would offload monitoring from main workstation
  - Considerations:
    - Storage: Solved with SSD HAT
    - Memory: Need to evaluate Grafana/Prometheus memory requirements
    - CPU: May need performance testing
    - Network: Ensure low-latency connection for real-time monitoring
  - Decision pending performance impact assessment of LadonStack on main workstation

### Current Infrastructure

- [x] Port reservations (99xx range for monitoring)
- [x] Basic monitoring dashboards
- [x] GPU metrics collection
- [x] Log aggregation
- [x] Storage monitoring (LVM, RAID)
- [x] System metrics collection
- [x] Systemd service integration

## ðŸ“‹ In Progress

- [ ] Alert rules setup
- [ ] Performance baseline establishment
- [ ] Query optimization for Loki logs
- [ ] Dashboard refinement for storage metrics
- [ ] Phoenix integration with Hades RAG pipeline
- [ ] Baseline LLM performance metrics collection

## âœ… Completed

- [x] LadonStack initial setup
- [x] Prometheus configuration
- [x] Grafana dashboards
- [x] Port standardization
- [x] System monitoring implementation
- [x] Persistent storage configuration
- [x] Systemd service management
- [x] Documentation updates
- [x] Phoenix observability platform integration
- [x] LLM/RAG monitoring infrastructure
- [x] Phoenix documentation and integration guides
