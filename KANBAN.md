# Olympus Project KANBAN

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Considerations

### Infrastructure Optimization

- [ ] **LadonStack Dedicated Hardware**
  - Raspberry Pi 4 with 4x 3.5" SSD HAT
  - Potential RAID configuration for redundancy
  - Would offload monitoring from main workstation
  - Considerations:
    - Storage: Solved with SSD HAT
    - Memory: Need to evaluate Grafana/Prometheus memory requirements
    - CPU: May need performance testing
    - Network: Ensure low-latency connection for real-time monitoring
  - Decision pending performance impact assessment of LadonStack on main workstation

### Current Infrastructure

- [x] Port reservations (99xx range for monitoring)
- [x] Basic monitoring dashboards
- [x] GPU metrics collection
- [x] Log aggregation
- [x] Storage monitoring (LVM, RAID)
- [x] System metrics collection
- [x] Systemd service integration

## ðŸ“‹ In Progress
