# Olympus Model Engine Migration Notes

## Overview
The Olympus Model Engine has been established as the fifth major component of the Olympus system, focusing on model management, inference, and optimization. This document tracks the migration process and integration considerations.

## Component Status

### Migrated Components
1. **Documentation**
   - Build documentation
   - vLLM integration notes
   - Architecture specifications

2. **Configuration**
   - Requirements file
   - Base configuration structure

### Pending Migration
1. **Source Code**
   - CLI interface
   - Model management utilities
   - Database schema and handlers
   - vLLM integration code

2. **Infrastructure**
   - Dockerfile configuration
   - Start-up scripts
   - Model storage structure

## Integration Notes

### Current Architecture
The Model Engine is now positioned as a core component with the following responsibilities:
- Model API and registry
- Inference engine (vLLM-based)
- Training pipeline
- Model optimization
- Configuration management

### HADES Integration
There is an identified need to evaluate the decoupling of model management functionality between HADES and the Model Engine:

1. **Current State**
   - Model management partially implemented in HADES
   - Separate model engine implementation

2. **Migration Strategy**
   - Phase 1: Maintain current functionality
   - Phase 2: Evaluate component boundaries
   - Phase 3: Implement clean separation or integration

3. **Considerations**
   - Performance requirements
   - Resource utilization
   - System coupling
   - API compatibility

## Technical Requirements

### System Dependencies
- CUDA 12.1 (via Docker)
- vLLM stable release
- GPU support with tensor parallelization
- SQLite database

### Infrastructure
- Docker-based deployment
- GPU passthrough configuration
- Volume management for model storage

## Next Steps

1. **Short Term**
   - Complete source code migration
   - Set up Docker environment
   - Establish API contracts

2. **Medium Term**
   - Evaluate HADES integration
   - Implement monitoring hooks
   - Develop testing framework

3. **Long Term**
   - Optimize resource usage
   - Scale model management
   - Enhance training pipeline
