# Project Olympus (Original) Migration Notes

## Components Preserved

### Model Management
- Model download and caching functionality from `app/services/`
- Quantized model listing capabilities
- Model service utilities
- Located in: `/hades/src/model_engine/legacy/`

### Documentation
- Build requirements and deployment overview
- System architecture notes
- Original requirements.txt
- Located in: `/docs/legacy/`

## Key Features Preserved
1. **Model Management**
   - Hugging Face model integration
   - Quantized model support
   - Model download and caching

2. **Architecture Patterns**
   - Service-based organization
   - API-driven design
   - Configuration management

## Integration Notes
- Model management code should be reviewed and updated to match new architecture
- Original Streamlit interface replaced by Delphi frontend
- API patterns may be useful for HADES MCP server design

## Future Considerations
1. **Model Engine Integration**
   - Review legacy model management code for useful patterns
   - Consider quantized model support in new architecture
   - Evaluate caching strategies

2. **Documentation**
   - Build requirements provide good baseline for system requirements
   - Deployment notes useful for containerization strategy
