# Model Engine

The Model Engine is a shared component across the Olympus ecosystem that provides unified model management, inference, and monitoring capabilities.

## Architecture

The Model Engine is organized into the following key components:

### Core Components

- **Model Management**: Handles model loading, versioning, and lifecycle
- **Inference Engine**: Provides unified inference interface across different model types
- **Model Registry**: Maintains model metadata and versioning
- **Monitoring**: Integration with Ladon for model performance monitoring

```

## Features

- Unified model interface across different model types (LLM, ML, etc.)
- Model versioning and lifecycle management
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Caching and optimization
- Integration with Ladon monitoring stack
- Support for different model hosting strategies (local, remote, containerized)

## Usage

```python
from model_engine import ModelEngine

# Initialize engine
engine = ModelEngine(config_path="config/default.yaml")

# Load model
model = engine.load_model("model_name", version="1.0.0")

# Run inference
result = model.infer(input_data)
```

## Integration

The Model Engine is designed to be used by various components in the Olympus ecosystem:

- **HADES**: For RAG operations and knowledge processing
- **Agents**: For specialized reasoning tasks
- **Delphi**: For direct model interactions via the UI

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

## Monitoring

The Model Engine integrates with Ladon for comprehensive monitoring:

- Model performance metrics
- Inference latency tracking
- Memory usage
- Error rates and types
- Cache hit/miss rates
