# Project Olympus Progress

## What works
1. **HADES Service**:
   - Successfully ingests documents into ArangoDB with vector and graph indexing.
   - Provides endpoints for querying the RAG pipeline, returning relevant context to the Model Engine.

2. **Model Engine**:
   - Serves an LLM via vLLM, handling inference requests from HADES.
   - Supports basic prompt engineering and returns text completions or short answers.

3. **Minimal Web UI**:
   - Provides a simple interface for testing queries and displaying results from the RAG + LLM pipeline.
   - Allows users to input questions and view relevant documents and final LLM-generated answers.

## What's left to build
1. **Enhanced HADES Features**:
   - Implement multi-hop graph queries and more refined retrieval strategies.
   - Integrate advanced memory tiers (Elysium/Asphodel/Lethe) for future scalability.

2. **Robust Model Engine**:
   - Develop a fine-tuning pipeline for adapting models with vLLM.
   - Scale the model engine to larger GPU-based deployments or multi-GPU distributed scaling.
   - Implement additional prompt engineering and advanced inference endpoints.

3. **Delphi (Full Web UI)**:
   - Build a rich data visualization interface.
   - Integrate agent orchestration and advanced dashboards for monitoring.

4. **Agents + LadonStack**:
   - Develop autonomous scheduling and multi-agent collaboration capabilities.
   - Implement system metrics and observability dashboards.

5. **RAG for Codebases**:
   - Design HADES to index and analyze codebases, leveraging ArangoDB's vector/graph capabilities.
   - Integrate LLMs for generating refactoring suggestions, documentation, or new feature implementations.

## Progress status
- **HADES**: Core prototype goals achieved; basic RAG features working as expected.
- **Model Engine**: Prototype-ready; serving LLMs and handling inference requests from HADES.
- **Minimal Web UI**: Basic interface operational; testing end-to-end query → retrieval → answer flows.
- **Future Directions**: Planning and design for advanced features are in progress, with initial implementation phases to be defined.
