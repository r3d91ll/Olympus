# HADES Active Context

## Current Focus
Implementing HADES's self-guided learning approach:

1. **Initial Training Phase**
   - Fine-tuning Qwen2.5 on ArangoDB documentation
   - Teaching AQL query generation through examples
   - Building initial reference knowledge base

2. **Learning Strategy**
   - Clear separation of procedural vs. reference knowledge
   - Using prompt engineering for guided learning
   - Developing expertise through practical application

3. **Skill Development**
   - Creating specialized LoRA adapters through practice
   - Building system components as learning exercises
   - Maintaining reference materials in ArangoDB

## Recent Changes
1. **Model Selection**
   - Chosen Qwen2.5-coder-instruct as base model
   - Planning initial fine-tuning on ArangoDB docs
   - Setting up self-guided learning pipeline

2. **Knowledge Organization**
   - Separating procedural knowledge (fine-tuning) from reference (ArangoDB)
   - Structuring learning progression
   - Implementing guided practice approach

3. **Development Strategy**
   - Using system to build itself
   - Learning through practical application
   - Creating specialized LoRA adapters as needed

## Next Steps
1. **Initial Training**
   - Prepare ArangoDB documentation dataset
   - Begin fine-tuning on AQL basics
   - Set up guided learning exercises

2. **Practice Environment**
   - Create structured learning tasks
   - Implement feedback mechanisms
   - Monitor skill development

3. **System Development**
   - Use HADES to build its own components
   - Develop specialized LoRA adapters
   - Expand reference knowledge base

## Current Challenges
1. **Learning Process**
   - Structuring effective learning progression
   - Balancing guided vs. self-directed learning
   - Measuring skill acquisition

2. **Knowledge Management**
   - Maintaining clear separation of knowledge types
   - Organizing reference materials effectively
   - Tracking skill development

3. **System Evolution**
   - Guiding self-improvement process
   - Managing LoRA adapter development
   - Ensuring stable learning progression
