# Diffusion-based Hierarchical Negative Sampling for Multimodal Knowledge Graphs

## Overview

This paper introduces a novel Diffusion-based Hierarchical Negative Sampling (DHNS) framework for Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC). The approach leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality negative samples while considering multiple modalities and varying levels of difficulty.

## Background

### Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs)

- Integrate diverse modalities:
  - Text
  - Images
  - Audio
- Used in applications like:
  - Multimodal question answering
  - Knowledge representation
  - Semantic reasoning

### Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC)

- Goal: Infer missing knowledge in incomplete graphs
- Critical for enhancing MMKG utility
- Relies heavily on negative sampling for training

## Challenges in Current Approaches

1. **Limited Semantic Understanding**
   - Current methods focus mainly on topological features
   - Neglect semantics from diverse modalities
   - Result in overly simple or invalid negative triples

2. **Indirect Quality Assessment**
   - GAN-based approaches rely on pre-sampled triples
   - Quality assessment depends on KGC model performance
   - Lack direct generation of high-quality negatives

3. **Fixed Margin Training**
   - One-size-fits-all approach to training margins
   - Ineffective across different hardness levels
   - Limited adaptability to varying negative triple complexity

## The DHNS Framework

### 1. Diffusion-based Hierarchical Embedding Generation (DiffHEG)

- Uses denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM)
- Directly generates entity embeddings for negative triples
- Features:
  - Considers multiple modality-specific embeddings
  - Generates samples at various hardness levels
  - Controls difficulty through diffusion time steps

### 2. Negative Triple-Adaptive Training (NTAT)

- Implements Hardness-Adaptive Loss (HAL)
- Adapts training to different hardness levels
- Enhances model's ability to handle diverse negative triples

## Key Innovations

1. **First Application of Diffusion Models**
   - Pioneering use in MMKGC context
   - Direct control over hardness levels
   - Integration of multimodal semantics

2. **Adaptive Training Approach**
   - Dynamic margin adjustment
   - Hardness-level-specific training
   - Comprehensive coverage of negative triple types

3. **Hierarchical Semantic Integration**
   - Captures diverse modality information
   - Generates high-quality negative samples
   - Maintains semantic coherence

## Experimental Results

### Performance Improvements

- Consistently achieved highest or second-highest scores across metrics
- Outperformed state-of-the-art baseline models
- Superior results in both unimodal and multimodal scenarios

### Key Findings

1. **MMKGC Performance**

   - Maintained performance across different datasets
   - Demonstrated robustness of the approach

## Practical Applications
