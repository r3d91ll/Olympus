# Multi-Agent Framework for Enhanced Error Detection in Knowledge Graphs

## Overview

This paper introduces MAKGED (Multi-Agent Knowledge Graph Error Detection), a novel framework that uses multiple agents for detecting errors in knowledge graphs. The approach combines structural graph information with semantic understanding through a collaborative multi-agent system.

## Background

### Knowledge Graph Errors

- Common in large-scale KGs built using rule-based web extraction
- Example: NELL contains ~600K incorrect triples (26% of total)
- Significantly impacts downstream task performance
- Most KG-driven tasks assume all triples are correct

### Current Limitations

1. **Single Viewpoint Evaluation**
   - Incomplete evaluations
   - Inaccurate confidence scores
   - Static graph structure usage
   - Fixed textual representations

2. **Lack of Transparency**
   - Single confidence score output
   - Limited context for decisions
   - Unclear evaluation process

## The MAKGED Framework

### 1. Bidirectional Subgraph Agents

Four specialized agents:

- **Head Entity Agents**:
  - Head_Forward_Agent (outgoing relations)
  - Head_Backward_Agent (incoming relations)
- **Tail Entity Agents**:
  - Tail_Forward_Agent (forward subgraphs)
  - Tail_Backward_Agent (backward subgraphs)

### 2. Hybrid Information Processing

- **Structural Analysis**:
  - Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for subgraph processing
  - Generates subgraph embedding vectors
  - Captures structural relationships

- **Semantic Analysis**:
  - LLama2 for text processing
  - Generates semantic embeddings
  - Provides contextual understanding

### 3. Information Integration

```text
Combined Embedding = Concatenate(GCN_Embedding, LLama2_Embedding)
```

- Unified representation combining:
  - Structural graph features
  - Semantic textual features
  - Contextual information

### 4. Decision Making Process

1. **Initial Evaluation**
   - Each agent independently assesses the triple
   - Uses combined structural and semantic information

2. **Discussion Rounds**
   - Multiple rounds of agent discussion
   - Structured voting mechanism
   - Collaborative decision making

3. **Final Decision**
   - Consensus-based outcome
   - Transparent reasoning process
   - Multiple perspective integration

## Experimental Results

### Performance Metrics

1. **Comparison with Embedding-based Methods**:
   - 10-20% improvement in accuracy
   - Significant F1-Score increase
   - Better structural understanding

2. **Comparison with PLM-based Methods**:

   - Enhanced complex error detection
   - Better precision in identification

3. **Comparison with LLM-based Methods**:

   - Better structural understanding
   - More accurate error detection

### Key Findings

   - Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models
   - Superior accuracy and F1-scores
   - Better recall rates

2. **Multi-Agent Advantage**
