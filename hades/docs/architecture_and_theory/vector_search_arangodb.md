# Vector Search in ArangoDB: Practical Insights and Hands-On Examples

## Introduction to Vector Search

Vector search is gaining traction for handling large, unstructured datasets like text, images, and audio. It works by comparing vector embeddings to find items with similar properties.

## ArangoDB's Vector Search Integration

ArangoDB integrates Facebook's FAISS library to bring scalable, high-performance vector search directly into its core, accessible via AQL (ArangoDB Query Language). This capability is currently in Developer Preview and will be in production release in Q1, 2025.

## Setting Up Vector Search in ArangoDB

### Step 1: Create a Vector Index Using AQL

```aql
db.items.ensureIndex( { name: "vector_cosine", type: "vector", fields: ["vector_data"], params: { metric: "cosine", dimension: 128, nLists: 100 } }
```

### Step 2: Perform a Vector Search Using AQL Queries

```aql
FOR doc IN items
LET score = APPROX_NEAR_COSINE(doc.vector_data, @query)
SORT score DESC
LIMIT 5
RETURN {doc, score}
```

## Combining Vector Search with Graph Traversals

ArangoDB's multi-model capability allows you to combine vector search with graph traversal for advanced use cases.

## GraphRAG

Combines vector search with knowledge graphs to enhance natural language query handling. It retrieves both semantically similar results and highly structured insights, making it ideal for use cases like law enforcement, fraud detection, and advanced recommendation systems.

## Implementing GraphRAG with ArangoDB

1. **Store Embeddings and Relationships**: Store embeddings and relationships in Document Collections.
2. **Set Up a Query Pipeline**: Combine vector search and graph traversal.
3. **Combine with an LLM**: Use the results to provide context for more accurate and context-aware responses.

## Natural Language Querying with LangChain

Integrate LangChain with ArangoDB to allow users to query using natural language. LangChain converts a user's natural language input into structured AQL queries.

## Conclusion

ArangoDB's vector search, powered by FAISS, is a force multiplier for combining advanced data science techniques with graph-based insights. It opens up endless possibilities for real-world problems.
